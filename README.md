B-DNS addon for Chrome lets you surf Namecoin and Emercoin domains:

* *.bit* - such as http://nx.bit
* *.lib* - such as http://rutracker.lib, http://flibusta.lib
* *.emc*
* *.bazar*
* *.coin*

**Attention: Chrome requires `http://` prefix**

If you type an address like `nx.bit` into the address bar and hit Enter - you will be taken to Google search page. You have to type `http://nx.bit` instead. See [this issue for details](https://github.com/B-DNS/Chrome/issues/2).
